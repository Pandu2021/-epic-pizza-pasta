Added by automation: favicon.svg (temporary gradient icon)

Action needed: Replace favicon.svg with company branding or supply PNG variants.

Suggested steps (manual):
1. Copy logo.png here as favicon.png (optimize to square, 512x512 ideally).
2. Create resized 180x180 (for Apple touch) and 32x32 (classic favicon) if desired.
3. Ensure index.html points to these files.
