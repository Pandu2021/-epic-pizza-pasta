# Security Audit Report - Epic Pizza & Pasta

**Audit Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues Found - Requires Fixes**

## Executive Summary

The Epic Pizza & Pasta repository has been audited for sensitive information and security vulnerabilities. While the codebase follows many good security practices, **2 critical security issues** were identified that need immediate attention.

## üîç Audit Scope

- Source code in `/Back-End` and `/Front-End` directories
- Configuration files (Docker, environment, build configs)
- Database migrations and schemas  
- Git history for previously committed sensitive files
- Package dependency files
- Test files and documentation

## ‚ùå Security Issues Found

### 1. **CRITICAL: Hardcoded Database Credentials**
**File:** `Back-End/docker-compose.yml`  
**Issue:** PostgreSQL credentials are hardcoded in plaintext
```yaml
POSTGRES_USER: pizza
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "PgAdmin#Pizza25"
```
**Risk:** High - Database credentials exposed in version control  
**Fix Required:** Move credentials to environment variables

### 2. **HIGH: Environment File Copied to Production Image**
**File:** `Back-End/Dockerfile` (Line 16)  
**Issue:** `.env` file is copied into Docker production image
```dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /app/.env ./.env
```
**Risk:** High - Sensitive environment variables could be exposed if image is shared  
**Fix Required:** Remove this line and use proper environment variable injection

## ‚úÖ Good Security Practices Found

### Environment Variable Management
- ‚úÖ Proper `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files (`.env`, `.key`, `.pem`, `.secret`)
- ‚úÖ `.env.example` uses placeholder values only
- ‚úÖ Code properly uses `process.env` for environment variable access
- ‚úÖ No actual `.env` files committed to repository

### Source Code Security
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded API keys, tokens, or secrets in source code
- ‚úÖ No sensitive information in comments or TODO notes
- ‚úÖ Proper JWT key management via environment variables
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection implemented correctly

### Data Protection
- ‚úÖ Database migrations contain only schema, no sensitive data
- ‚úÖ No database dumps or backup files committed
- ‚úÖ No log files with potential sensitive information

### Git History
- ‚úÖ No sensitive files found in git history
- ‚úÖ No previously committed and removed sensitive files detected

## üîß Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Secure Docker Compose Configuration
Replace hardcoded credentials with environment variables:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER:-pizza}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${DB_NAME:-epic_pizza}
```

Create `docker-compose.env.example`:
```
DB_USER=pizza
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
DB_NAME=epic_pizza
```

### Fix 2: Secure Dockerfile
Remove the .env file copy and use proper environment injection:
```dockerfile
# Remove this line:
# COPY --from=builder /app/.env ./.env

# Environment variables should be injected at runtime via:
# docker run -e NODE_ENV=production -e DATABASE_URL=... your-image
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Environment Variables
- Use Docker secrets or orchestration-specific secret management
- Never commit actual `.env` files
- Regularly rotate sensitive credentials

### 2. Production Deployment
- Use separate environment files for different stages
- Implement proper secret management (Kubernetes secrets, Docker secrets)
- Ensure production images don't contain development credentials

### 3. Monitoring
- Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
- Implement credential scanning tools
- Regular security audits

## üö® Immediate Action Required

**Priority 1:** Fix the hardcoded database credentials in `docker-compose.yml`  
**Priority 2:** Remove `.env` file copying from `Dockerfile`  
**Timeline:** These issues should be fixed before any production deployment

## üìã Security Checklist for Future Development

- [ ] Never commit actual `.env` files
- [ ] Use placeholder values in example configuration files  
- [ ] Review Docker files for sensitive file copying
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks for sensitive file detection
- [ ] Regular security audits of dependencies
- [ ] Use secret scanning tools in CI/CD

## Conclusion

The repository demonstrates good security awareness in most areas but requires immediate fixes for the identified credential exposure issues. Once these are addressed, the security posture will be significantly improved.
